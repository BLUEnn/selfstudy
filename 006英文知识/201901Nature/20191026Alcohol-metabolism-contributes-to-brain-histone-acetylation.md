Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic regulation is dependent on metabolic state, and implicates specific metabolic factors in neural functions that drive behaviour In neurons, acetylation of histones relies on the metabolite acetyl-coa which is produced from acetate by chromatin-bound acetyl-coa synthetase 2 (ACSS2) Notably, the breakdown of alcohol in the liver leads to a rapid increase in levels of blood acetate, and alcohol is therefore a major source of acetate in the body. 

Histone acetylation in neurons may thus be under the influence of acetate that is derived from alcohol, with potential effects on alcohol-induced gene expression in the brain, and on behaviour. 

Here, using in vivo stable-isotope labelling in mice, we show that the metabolism of alcohol contributes to rapid acetylation of histones in the brain, and that this occurs in part through the direct deposition of acetyl groups that are derived from alcohol onto histones in an ACSS2-dependent manner. 

A similar direct deposition as observed when mice were injected with heavy-labelled acetate in vivo. In a pregnant mouse, exposure to labelled alcohol resulted in the incorporation of labelled acetyl groups into gestating fetal brains In isolated primary hippocampal neurons ex ivo, extracellular acetate induced transcriptional programs related to learning and memory, which were sensitive to ACSS2 inhibition We show that alcohol-related associative learning requires ACSS2 in vivo. 

These findings suggest that there is a direct link between alcohol metabolism and gene regulation, through the ACS$2-dependent acetylation of histones in the brain.



Todetermine whether acetate thatis produced from the breakdownof alcohol contributestodynamic acetylation of histones in the brain, we used in vivo stable-isotope labelling of protein acetylation, monitore by mass spectrometry (Fig 1 a) Acetyl groups derived from ethanol were rapidly incorporated into histone acetylation the brain, both in the hippocampus (Fig 1 b) and in the prefrontal cortex (Extended Data Fig Ic). The incorporation of labelled alcohol into histone acetylation was dynamicin the hippocampus, and heavy labelling decreased to base line levels 8 h after intraperitoneal injection (Extended Data Fig 2 a, b This rapid in vivo labelling of histone acetylation in the hippocampus was absent in mice that were injected with non-labelled alcohol (Extended Data Fig 2 d). Similar labelling occurred in the liver (Fig 1 c), which is the principal site alcohol metabolism and expresses high levels of ACSS27. By contrast, the abundance of labelled acetylated histones was lower in skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius muscle; Extended Data Figs. Ld, 2 e). Which has relatively lower ACS$2 expression levels,.

To test whether ACSS2 is required for the incorporation of alcohol derived acetate into the brain, we attenuated the expression of ACSS2

in the dorsal hippocampus (dhpc) by SHRNA knockdown using a pre- viously validated viral vector. In these Acss2-knockdown mice, we compared alcohol-derived histone acetylation separately in the dhpc in which ACSS2 was reduced, and in the ventral hippocampus (VHPC), In which AC$$2 expression was not affected. Notably, knockdown of ACSS2 prevented the incorporation of heavy-labelled acetyl groups derived from alcohol into histone acetylation in the dhpc (Fig 2 a). By contrast, in the same mouse, incorporation of the heavy label into histoneacetylation in the VHPC wasnotaffected (Fig 2 b). These in vivo data indicate that acetate that is derived from the metabolism of alcohol in the liver is transported to the brain and readily incorporated into AC$$2-dependent histone acetylation (see Supplementary Information for further discussion)

Although the majority of alcohol metabolism takes place in the liver alcohol fractions may also be converted to acetate in the brain the enzymes catalase and cytochrome P450 2 E1 (CYP2 E1. We therefore assessed the contribution of acetyl groups thatare derived fromextra- cellular acetate to histone acetylation in the brain In mice that were intraperitoneally injected with2 g kg deuterated acetate (acetate-d3) the labelled acetate was rapidly incorporated into histone acetylation in the brain, at similar levels in both hippocampus and cortex (Extended Data Fig 2 f, g). Relative levels of the labelled acetate were highest at 30 min and returned to background levels at 4 h after injection, indi cating that acetate-derived acetyl groups were quickly incorporated into brain histone acetylation and showing the rapid turnover of this process. Notably, we found that levels of acetate in the hippocampus Were significantly increased 30 min after injection of alcohol or acetate  (Extended Data Fig 2 h), and we detected substantial amounts of heavy cetate in the hippocampus as early as 30 min after injection with deu ated ethanol (ethanol-d6) (Extended Data Fig

We further investigated whether alcohol-derived carbon groups

incorporated into other key metabolites in hippocampal tissue. Although we detected no incorporation of the alcohol-derived label into pools of glucose and 3- hydrox butyrate, and only a fraction (less chan 1%) into the pool of lactate, we found that alcohol labels pools of glutamine in the hip 3 b-e). In the brain de novo synthesis of glutamine in astrocytes replenishes the glutamate- lutamine cycle, in which glutamine is trafficked into glutamate neurons for production of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Citrate-the substrate thatis used by ATP citrate lyase to producenucleo-cytoplasmic etyl-coa-is generated from a-ketoglutarate, which can be derived from carboxylation of glutamine: this path could therefore provide another route through which alcohol contributes to histone acetylation However, we detected only traces of the alcohol-derived label in pools of citrate or isocitrate in the hippocampus (Extended Data Fig 3). Taken

with our mass spectrometry data in Acss2-knockdown mice these results support the view that alcohol-derived acetate

gest that the increased levels of blood acetate from alcohol metabolism promote ACS$2-mediated dynamic acetylation of histones in the brain We examined the functional relevance ofalcohol-derived a

histone acetylation in regulating the expression of genes in the hippocampus. We found that treating wild-type mice with alcohol resulted in significant enrichment of peaks for K9-acetylated histone H3 (H3 k9 ac) and H3 k27 ac-both at key neuronal genes and genome-wide-and that this enrichment was greatly attenuated in Acss2-knockdown mice (Fig. 2 c g: chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (chilp-se

tion). Forexample, we observed Acss2-dependent and alcohol-induced histone acetylation at Fstd (follistatin- like 1) (Fig. C), a neuronal gene that has been implicated in the development and migration of neurons and alcohol-induced enrichment of H3 k27 ac at Cepi.52 (centrosomal protein of 152 kda) (Extended Data Fig 4 a), an important regulator of Genome integrity that is recurrently mutated in intellectual develop mental disorders and microcephaly. Anotherexample is Uimci (ubiq- uitin-interaction-motif containing I) (Extended Data Fig 4 b), which has previously been linked with neurodevelopmental disorders and autism Evaluating the Chip-seq data for histone acetylation on a genome-wide scale, we found that 74% of the H3 k9 ac peaks that changed after ex sure to alcohol were increased  (339 out of changed peaks called with AACS2: 10%false discovery rate (FDR) used as the significance threshold for Diffbind; Fig 2 d), and that 60% of the differential H3 k27 ac peaks

reincreased by alcohol (490 out of 816 peaks; Chip-seq performedih

after alcohol injection:  (Fig. 2 e). Notably, this response was eliminated in Acss2-knockdown mice: 98% of the H3 k9 acand H3 k27 ac peaks tha increased in wild-type mice after alcohol treatment were not induced in

the dhpc ofacss2-knockdown mice (Fig. 2 f, g). We then performed RN

sequencing  (RNA-SCG) to characterize the transcriptional responsean found that H3 k9 ac and H3 k27 ac drove gene expression genome-wide in wild-type mice thatwere treated with alcohol (Extended Data Fig 5 a, b). However, in line with the Chip-seq data, this response was blunted in

Acss2-knockdown mice (Extended Data Fig 5 c, d). A functional analysis of the genes that were both hyperacetylated and induced by alcohol in

ACS$2-dependent mannerrevealed enrichment of genes with func- tions in protein binding, cell junctions, postsynaptic density and drug

response (Extended Data Fig, Se, 5). Together, our in vivo findings show that treatment with alcohol leads to increased histone acetylation and transcriptional activity in the dhpc in an AC$$2-dependent manner Because alcohol and acetate have pleiotropic effects on brain cir- cuitry and metabolism", wedeveloped an ex vivo assay to more closely model the direct effects of exogenous acetate on gene expression. We used isolated mouse primary hippocampal neurons, cultured for o week after isolation and subsequently treated with 5 MM acetate, investigate the transcriptional response to supraphysiological levels of acetate that mimic the influx ofexogenous acetate during alcohol intake. Urthermore, to determine the specific role of ACSS2 in transcriptional responses to acetate, we used a highly specificsmall-molecule inhibitor of ACSS2 (ACS$2 i: C, Hus N, O, S,) (Extended Data Fig 6 a) In primary hippocampal neurons, supplementation with acetate induced the expression of 3, 613 genes (Fig 3 a, Extended Data Fig 6 b). Sing an analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, we found that these genes are involved in nervous system processes, including signal transduction and learning and memory (Extended Data Fig 6 c). By contrast, treatment

with acetate resulted in the downregulation of genes that are involved in immune system processes (Extended Data Fig 6 d). In the presence of ACS$2 i, 2, 107 of the genes that wereinduced by acetate were no longer upregulated (Extended Data Fig 6 f), indicating that acetate-induced transcription relies heavily on the catalytic activity of ACSS2. Notably, acetate-induced genes were not regulated by treatment with ACSSI in the absence of acetate (Extended Data Fig 6 e). GO analysis of the upregulated genes that weresensitive to Css2 ishowed enrichment for ervous system processes, behaviour, leamning and memory (Extended Data Fig 6 f) and specific genes showed sensitivity to ACSSI (Extende Data Fig 7 a-d). For example, Slci7 a7 was upregulated after treatment of wild-type hippocampus cells with acetate, but induction was dimin- ished when A$$2 wasinhibited (Extended Data Fig 7 a). Slcl7 a7 encodes vesicular glutamate receptor l, which is implicated in hippocampal syn aptic plasticity, addiction and alcohol use. In addition, impaired DNA methylation of Ccnjl (cyclin J-like) has been linked to prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD  (Extended Data Fig 7 b). Further analysis revealed that the Acss2 i-sensitive and acetate. Upregulated genes were also bound by hippocampal ACS$2 (which has been investigated by Chip-seq previously) and binding was proximal to the promoter at baseline without any direct behavioural stimulation in vivo (Extended Data Fig 8 a). GO analysis linked these ACSS2 target genes to intricate plasticity-related mechanisms that involve axon genesis and the activity of voltage-gated ion channels (Fig. 3 b). Cor- respondingly,, motif analysis of Acss2-targeted, acetate-induced and Acss2 i-sensitive genes implicated theinvolvemento neuronal transcrip tion factors-including E2 F3 and NR5 A2 (Fig 3 c), which have been linked to neurodifferentiation and drug-related regulation of behaviour There was asubstantial overlap between genes that were upregulated

by alcohol in vivo in the dhpc and genes that were induced by acetate ex vivo-rna-seq identified 830 alcohol-responsive hippocampal genes that overlapped withtheex vivo differentially expressed genes (rig 3 t whichsuggests that translating our ex vivo model to the in vivo situation is valid. GO analysis for these overlapping genes highlighted the enrich mentof genes that arerelated to neuronal plasticity,, including those with roles in synapses, neuron projection and axons; however, generelated to ribosomal and mitochondrial functions were alsoenriched (Extended Data Fig 8 b). Notably, a previously published microarray dataset o hippocampal genes that are regulated by alcohol in vivo also showed substantial overlap with our list of genes that are induced by acetate ex vivo (81 of 214 (38%) alcohol-responsive hippocampal genes in the micro- array) Next, weshowed  (starting from a complementary analysis of our in vivo data) that target genes of ACSS2 in the hippocampus that show alcohol-induced H3 k9 ac in vivo were also upregulated by treatment of hippocampal neurons with acetate ex vivo, and that Acss2 i blocks this gene induction  (Fig. 3 e). The equivalent relationship existed for hip pocampal genes that show alcohol-induced H3 k27 acin vivo: these genes were not induced by acetate ex vivo in the presence of ACSS2 I (Fig 3).

Together, these findings suggest that AC: SS2 may have a rolein alcohol related learning by coordinating alcohol-induced histone acetylation and gene expression To examine potential behavioural effects in wild type and Acss2-knockdown mice, we performed ethanol-mediated conditioned place preference (CPP), which has previously been used to assess ethanol-associated learning ". In this paradigm, mice areexposed neutral and rewarding stimulin distinct spatial compartments, d tinguished by environmental cues. After conditioning. Cppis measured by allowing the mice free access to either compartment and measuring the time spent in the chamber that is associated with rewarding stimuli  (Fig 4 a) To assess place-preference learning, we calculated the mean time spentin the conditioned (paired with alcohol) and unconditioned  (paired with saline) chambers (Extended Data Fig 9 c), as well as a CPP score, which we defined as the difference between the timespentinthe conditioned and the unconditioned chamber (Fig4 b). We found that Delivered during training  (P=0.0391 Wilcoxon test) (Fig 4 b). Notal

Overall, our ex vivo and in vivo molecular data, together with our

ehavioural findings, show that ACSS2 isrequired for the incorporatio of heavy-labelled acetate into acetylated histones in the d HPC, and that this facilitates memory-related gene expression and alcohol-related associative learning (Fig. 4 C). These results establish ACSS2 as a prom ising candidate for therapeutic intervention in alcohol-use disorders, in which the memory of alcohol-associated environmental cues is a primary driver of craving and relapse.

The direct pathway that we identify here substantially furthers our understanding of alcohol-induced epi geneticregulation in the brain, which has previously been limited to the indirect effects of alcohol-induced intracellular signalling and changes in the expression or activity of histone-modifying enzymes. The direct pathway contributes to a large proportion of the histoneacetylationthat occurs after ethanol exposure, and suggests that the incorporation of Alcohol-derived acetyl groups is physiologically relevant and associated

with the transcriptional and behavioural adaptations that are induced by ethanol. Notably, our findings suggest that other peripheral source

of physiological acetate-primarily the gut microbiome-may affect

central histoneacetylation and brain function in asimilar manner, which

may either control or foster other metabolic syndromes. Translational

treatmentstrategies that target this nexus between peripheral metabolic activity and neuroepigenetic regulation may pave the way for therapeutic interventions for alcohol use and other neuropsychiatric disorders.
